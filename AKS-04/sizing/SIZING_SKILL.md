# Using the Elasticsearch Sizing Skill

This project was initialized with the **medium** sizing profile.
**Platform**: OpenShift

For detailed, workload-specific sizing, invoke the sizing skill in your AI assistant.

## Recommended Skill: elasticsearch-openshift-sizing-assistant-legacy

> OpenShift-specific sizing with Context7 MCP integration

### Load the Skill

```
load skill elasticsearch-openshift-sizing-assistant-legacy
```

### Provide Your Requirements

The skill needs these inputs:

1. **Daily Ingestion Rate**: How much data per day (GB/day)
2. **Retention Period**: How long to keep data (days)
3. **Number of Replicas**: Usually 1 for production (data x 2)
4. **Query Workload**: Light, moderate, or heavy
5. **Platform**: OpenShift

### Example Prompt

```
I need sizing for an Elasticsearch cluster on OpenShift:
- Ingestion: 200 GB/day
- Retention: 30 days
- Replicas: 1
- Query load: Moderate (10 concurrent users, dashboards)
- Use case: Application logs and APM data
```

### What You'll Get

- Node count and specifications per tier (hot/cold/frozen)
- Memory/CPU/storage per node
- JVM heap settings
- Storage class recommendations
- Resource requests/limits for ECK
- Capacity planning spreadsheet values
- Platform-specific infrastructure recommendations

## Current Configuration

The sizing files in this directory provide a starting point:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `config.json` | Machine-readable sizing config (tier-based) |
| `capacity-planning.csv` | Import into Excel for planning |
| `resource-requirements.yaml` | Kubernetes resource totals |

Adjust these values based on the sizing skill's recommendations.
