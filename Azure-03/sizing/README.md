## Re-sizing with AI Assistant

For adjustments or re-sizing, use the recommended skill:

```bash
# Load the sizing skill
load skill devops-02-2026

# Example prompt:
# "Adjust sizing for increased ingestion to 400 GB/day"
```

## Capacity Planning Guidelines

### Tier Strategy
- **Hot**: 7-14 days of data, fastest queries
- **Cold**: 30-90 days, reduced resources, slower queries
- **Frozen**: 90+ days, minimal local storage, uses snapshots

### Memory Sizing
- JVM heap should be 50% of container memory (max 31GB heap)
- Hot tier: Higher memory for indexing performance
- Frozen tier: Memory for cache, not full dataset

### Storage Strategy
- Hot: Premium/SSD for write throughput
- Cold: Standard storage, larger capacity
- Frozen: Local cache + object storage (S3/Azure Blob/GCS)
